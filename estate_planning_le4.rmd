###buy-sell agreement: 

Why we need buy-sell agreement? 
Because closely held businesses are not marketable and create liquidity problems when one of the business partners wishes to terminate and transfer of ownership. 

The CFP exam would focus on the buy-sell agreement at the death of an owner funded through the use of life insurance. 

Two methods in transferring ownership: 
* Each owner owning an insurance policyt on each of the other owners. The estate of each owner then commits to selling the ownership to the surviving owners. 

The characteristics of buy-sell agreement: 
- each shareholder owns a policy on all of the other owners 
- premiums are nondeductible 
- life insurance cannot be attached to the creditors 
- tax-free benefits to the remaning owners 
- step-up basis, of remaining owners' interests 

Good side: (1) Step-up basis (2) life insurance can not be attached by the company's creditors 
Bad side: (1) own a policy on each of the other owners, the formula to determine the number of policies is N * (N - 1) 

Another way: stock redemption owning the life policies with each other , they commmit to sell their ownership back to the company 

- company owns a policy on each other 
- premiums are not deductible 
- company purchases deceased owner's interests 
- no step-up in basis of remaining owner's interest 
- does not allow for an altering of ownership ratios 

good: this allows the company to purchase one policy on each owner which siginificantly reduce the number of policies required if there are several owners. the entity 
insurance is that the number of the policies is reduced to one policy per partner or shareholder. 
bad: the remaining owners did not get a step-up basis

    The bene of the tax-advantaged account will be eligible for a deduction in the form of a miscellaneous itemized deduction not subject to 2% of AGI floor. 
    However, they had the income-tax on these accounts 

** Coporate Redemption from closely held businesses 
   C-corp held to cover estate liquidity needs-the corporation itself. This kind of redemption can transform an illiquid asset into a liquid asset. 
   more than 35% of the decedent's adjusted gross estate must consist of the closely held business interests. The FMV of all of the closely held business interests can be 
   aggregated to meet the 35% test if the decedent owned at least 20% of each company's outstanding stocks. 
   
** Distribution of Assets: 
   Administrator will distribute the estate's assets in lieu of a cash payment to creditors and those providing estate administration services. This is not possible
   for the payment of taxes-both the federal and state governments require a cash payment within nine months of the decedent's date of death. 
   
   Loans for payments of taxes and other costs: 
   Borrow money to cover estate taxes and administration expeneses of the decedent.
